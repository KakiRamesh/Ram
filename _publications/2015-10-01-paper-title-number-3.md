This paper presents a deep learning and image processing approach for identifying mechanical fasteners in aerospace assembly lines. YOLO-v5 for component classification based on head and lateral shape is used and achieved 99.6% mean average precision. Also developed an image processing method to measure fastener dimensions, including thread pitch, with high accuracy (100% for standard sizes, max 0.05 mm error for pitch).
