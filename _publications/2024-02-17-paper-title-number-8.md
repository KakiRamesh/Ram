This paper presents a deep learning approach to automate quality assurance in vehicle assembly, focusing on detecting cross marks on vehicle chassis. The researchers used the YOLOv5 model, adapting its architecture and parameters for this specific task. Achieved high accuracy, with a mean average precision (mAP) of 98% or higher, demonstrating the potential of deep learning to improve precision and reduce errors in vehicle assembly quality control.
