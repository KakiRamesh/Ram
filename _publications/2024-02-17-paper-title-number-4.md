This study compares five machine learning algorithms (ANN, GBR, SVR, DTR, and RFR) for predicting the thermal conductivity of TiO2-water nanofluids using a dataset of 228 data points. The gradient boosting regression (GBR) algorithm performed best, achieving 99% accuracy on both training and test sets, with the study also finding that nanoparticle shape significantly influences thermal conductivity predictions.
