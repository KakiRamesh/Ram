This paper presents a vision-based system for automating mechanical assembly lines by identifying and classifying different types of bolts. The system uses a novel method to calculate bolt pitch and dimensions, achieving 98% accuracy in part identification with minimal hardware requirements and millisecond-level processing speeds, making it suitable for use with moving components on a conveyor.
