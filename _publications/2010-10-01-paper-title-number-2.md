This paper presents a machine learning approach for identifying surface defects in shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) using high-resolution images. Applied various image processing techniques to extract geometrical features of welds, then built CNN and ResNet50 models to classify acceptable beads and surface defects, achieving over 98% accuracy for both models.
