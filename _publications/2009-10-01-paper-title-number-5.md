This paper presents an experimental study on liquid film behavior in falling-film systems using high-speed imaging and machine learning techniques. It illustrates how parameters like Reynolds number and tube spacing affect flow characteristics such as jet diameter and film thickness, developing image analysis and machine learning models to quantify and predict these flow parameters for improved system design.
